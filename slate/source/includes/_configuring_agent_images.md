## Configuring agent images
You can set an app maker's image in your app (as pictured below) by creating a <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a> image associated with the app maker's email address.
<img style="width:50%; min-width:200px; max-width:400px;" src="/images/agent_thumb.png" alt="Set agent images"/>
