## Front

[Front](https://frontapp.com/) is a powerful multi-channel inbox management software that takes out the pain of team inboxes and enables you to scale your customer support, hiring, sales and more. This integration will allow Front to power your conversations with customers over messaging.

### Configuring Front to work with Smooch

The Front integration is built entirely on top of Smooch's public [REST API](/rest), which makes the integration steps different from other integrations like [Slack](#slack) or [Zendesk](#zendesk). You can find the full installation instructions [here](https://community.frontapp.com/t/q56nk7/how-to-enable-and-use-the-smooch-integration).
