If your users are messaging you via our [Twilio](#twilio), [Messenger](#facebook-messenger), [Email](#email-channel) or [Telegram](#telegram) integrations, they'll get a web link instead of a buy button. It will take them to a payment web page where we use [Checkout.js](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout) from Stripe to secure the payment. This mechanism is also used for Smooch Web Messenger versions older than 2.1.
