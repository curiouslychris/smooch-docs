# Becoming an Integration partner

Become an integration partner to:

- easily acquire API credentials from Smooch app owners via [OAuth](/guide/oauth/) for your integration

- place your integration in the [Smooch marketplace](https://app.smooch.io/integrations)

- develop custom solution for Smooch apps.

## How to become a partner

1. You can apply to be a Smooch partner on the [partnership page](https://smooch.io/partners/) of our Website. Our partnership team will connect with you.

2. The partnership team will ask you to provide assets to market your integration in the marketplace.

3. When you've built your integration, checkout the [OAuth documentation](/guide/oauth/), then reach out to the partnership team and provide them with a redirect URL to complete the OAuth process, as well as a URL from which users can initiate the Oauth process.

4. The partner team will provide you with a client ID and secret that you can use to complete the [OAuth flow](/guide/oauth/).
