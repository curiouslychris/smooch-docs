## Viber

Our [Viber integration](https://app.smooch.io/integrations/viber) allows users to send you messages through a Viber Public Account. You will receive these messages in one of our other channels like Slack, HipChat or Help Scout.
Your replies will be sent back to users through the Viber Public Account.

### Configuring Viber

Once you have your Public Account token, copy and paste it into the Public Account token box on the Viber configuration page.
Then click on "Connect your Viber Public Account".
