# Other Integrations FAQ

## How do I install Smooch Web Messenger on my Shopify store?

You can install our Shopify plugin on your e-commerce store. Find it in the [Shopify plugin directory](https://apps.shopify.com/smooch)

## How do I add options in Smooch.init() in Shopify?

When you integrate Smooch with Shopify, we'll create a file called `snippets/smooch.liquid` in your theme. From there, you can access the `Smooch.init` call and add any options that we provide. Learn more about the options on the [Web Messenger GitHub page](https://github.com/smooch/smooch-web#individual-functions).

## How can I test Stripe?

Stripe provides two modes, one live mode and one test mode. The test mode allows you to use fake credit card and to simulate transactions. You will find more information on their [website](https://stripe.com/guide/dashboard#livemode-and-testing).
