# Business Quickstart

## Introduction

Smooch allows you to connect any number of channels that customers message over, to whatever business system your team uses.

This quickstart guide will show you how to connect Facebook Messenger as a channel, and [Slack](https://slack.com/) as a business system to Smooch, so that you can answer customer queries from Facebook using your Slack team.

## Get a Facebook page

If you don't already have one, [create a new page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create/).

## Connect Facebook to Smooch

If you haven't already, sign up for a [Smooch account](https://app.smooch.io/), and follow SmoochBot's instructions to connect Facebook Messenger.

 You can also connect Facebook Messenger from the [integration page](https://app.smooch.io/integrations/messenger).

Now, whenever someone sends a message to your Facebook page, it will also be sent to Smooch. Great! Let's figure out a way to answer them!

## Connect Smooch to a business system

The business system allows you to manage the conversation from whatever messaging channels are connected to Smooch.

We are using [Slack](https://slack.com/) as our business system, but you can just as easily use any other business system integration from our [marketplace](https://app.smooch.io/integrations/categories/business-systems), including [email](https://app.smooch.io/integrations/email).

If you don't already have a Slack team, you can get one for free [here](https://slack.com/create).

To connect your Slack team, simply go to the [Smooch integration page](https://app.smooch.io/integrations/slack) and click "connect".

## Have a back-and-forth conversation

Navigate to the Facebook page you connected to Smooch and send a message to it as a user. Now if you go check your Slack team, you'll see a new channel has opened! You can reply to the user in that channel by typing a slash command followed by your message _/sk my message_.

That's it, you've just set up Smooch for business.
