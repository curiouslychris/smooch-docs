# Customization

## Embedded mode

To embed the widget in your existing markup, you need to pass `embedded: true` when calling `Smooch.init`. By doing so, you are disabling the auto-rendering mechanism and you will need to call `Smooch.render` manually. This method accepts a DOM element which will be used as the container where the widget will be rendered.



<aside>
The embedded widget will take full width and height of the container.  
You must give it a height, otherwise, the widget will collapse.

```js
Smooch.init({
    appToken: 'your_app_token',
    embedded: true
});


Smooch.render(document.getElementById('chat-container'));
```
