# Action Buttons

Action buttons can be used for a variety of different purposes, and come in many forms. The current supported types of actions are:

* [Link Buttons](#links) - Used to refer the user somewhere else (a webpage, phone number, mailto, deep link, etc.).
* [Buy Buttons](#requesting-payments) - Used to request payment from the user.
* [Reply Buttons](#replies) - Used to present the user with suggested reply options. Cannot be mixed with other action types.
* [Postback Buttons](#postbacks) - Used to trigger server-side logic when pressed.

Actions can be sent through the [REST API](http://docs.smooch.io/rest#action-buttons), or by using one of the [shorthand syntaxes](http://blog.smooch.io/how-to-make-buttons-images-payments-with-smooch-a-syntax-cheatsheet/) in your message text.
