## User linking

If a user starts chatting with you and would like to continue the chat on another messaging channel such as Facebook Messenger, they will have the option to link their Facebook account and continue that same conversation.

These conversations will be merged automatically, allowing you to reply to the customer from the same thread wherever they choose.
When you reply to your user, Smooch will intelligently detect which messaging channel they most recently used and make sure that a user doesn't get spammed with push notifications if they happen to have multiple messaging channels linked.

For example, if a user visits your site and would like to close the tab, they can choose to 'Send to Messenger'. This will connect their conversation to Facebook Messenger and allow them to close the tab and move on.
