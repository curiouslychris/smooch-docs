### Transaction fees

Smooch takes a 0.5% + 20Â¢ fee on every payment we facilitate. This is separate from the [Stripe fees](https://stripe.com/ca/pricing) which are currently at 2.9% + 30Â¢. For example, on a $100 USD payment, Smooch will receive $0.70 USD and Stripe $3.20 USD.

### Configuring Stripe

From the Stripe integration page, select which Stripe mode you want Smooch to be using. 

![Stripe integration page ui](Stripe_integration_page_ui.png)

Use Test mode during development. While in this mode you can use Stripe's [test credit card numbers](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards) to make transactions without using real money. Use Live mode to get real money ðŸ’¸.

Then Click "Authenticate your Stripe account". This will send you to a Stripe page where you can select which Stripe account to link Smooch with.

If you are using test mode, notice the "Skip this account form" at the top of the Stripe page. There is no need for a bank account in test mode.

### Requesting payments

While inside a conversation with a user you can send a buy button with the following syntax

```
$[Button label here](25.00)
```

This works from any channel you configured to use with Smooch.

The amount you specify can be just a dollars amount or dollars and cents as in the example. Note that all amounts are in USD.

Once the user completes a payment you'll get a confirmation along with a link to the payment page on Stripe.
