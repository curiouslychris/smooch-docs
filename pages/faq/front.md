# Front FAQ

## How can I see the user info inside Front interface?
Front has 2 integrations with Smooch: one that handles messaging the customer and another that pulls profile information into the Front user interface.

This second Smooch integration is hidden in Front's settings and needs to be enabled separately from the first one through the menu API & Integrations.

When this second integration is enabled, you will be see a dropdown menu on their sidebar from where you can select 'Smooch' and get access to all information that our API gives.

## Why do I experience a delay when sending an answer to my customers in Front?

Front has an 'undo sendâ€™ feature that causes a delay. You can disable it on the Smooch Inbox settings inside Front. ![](http://i.imgur.com/cMKn1BP.png)
