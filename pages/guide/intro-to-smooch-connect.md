# Smooch Connect

Smooch has a rapidly growing [partner ecosystem](https://app.smooch.io/integrations) which helps businesses connect a variety of different business apps to messaging. You can join this ecosystem by implementing Smooch Connect into your product. When you do, your customers will be able to click a button that like this:

<a href="https://app.smooch.io/oauth/authorize?client_id=shoplifter&response_type=code"><img alt="Add to Smooch" height="40" width="165" src="https://cdn.smooch.io/images/add_to_smooch.png" srcset="https://cdn.smooch.io/images/add_to_smooch.png 1x, https://cdn.smooch.io/images/add_to_smooch@2x.png 2x"/></a>

Clicking this button allows your customers to connect your app to their configured messaging channels and is a great way to grow your user base and provide additional messaging capabilities to your customers. You can learn more about becoming a Smooch partner [here](/guide/becoming-an-integration-partner/).

## Sample App

In order to make implementing Smooch Connect in your app easy, we've built a simple sample app called Shoplifter. Shoplifter demonstrated a working Smooch Connect implementation. You can try it out on the [Shoplifter demo site](https://shoplifter.herokuapp.com/).

Once you've run through the demo, take a look at the [Shoplifter source code](https://github.com/smooch/shoplifter) to see how it works under the hood.
