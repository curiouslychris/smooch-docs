# Dashboard FAQ

## Where do I find my app token & API Keys?
The "Settings" tab on the dashboard displays your app token and allows you to create API keys to use with other applications that connect to your Smooch app. You can generate "account-level" keys that grant permission to your entire account from the dropdown menu in the top right of the page. Simply click your account name and avatar and select "Account" from the dropdown.

## Is it possible to close my account?
We don't close accounts on Smooch right now. Instead, simply disable your integrations from the overview page.

## How do I invite a colleague to my Smooch account?
You can add your teammates directly to the different business systems we support like Slack, HelpScout. Unfortunately, Smooch doesn't yet provide support for team members to manage the Smooch configuration using their own account, you'll all have to share the same accounts.

## Does Smooch provide analytics?
Most of the usiness systems we support (Front, HelpScoutâ€¦) provide performance analytics within their platform.
You may also find some of the [analytics tools](https://app.smooch.io/integrations/categories/bot-platform) in our integrations directory useful.

## Does Smooch provide a specific interface to answer my customers?
