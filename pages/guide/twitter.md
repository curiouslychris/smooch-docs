# Twitter DM

Our [Twitter DM integration](https://app.smooch.io/integrations/twitter) allows you to send & receive direct messages on Twitter using your own account. You will receive these messages in a [business system](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/business-systems/) or with [webhooks](https://docs.smooch.io/rest/#webhooks).

## Setup

Access to Twitter’s Direct Messages is restricted during the Beta period. We’ll be granting select access to qualifying customers. Please [contact us](https://smooch.formstack.com/forms/twitter) if you’re interested to connect your Smooch app to Twitter’s Direct Messages. 

Alternately, you can connect your own Twitter app via the [integration API](https://docs.smooch.io/rest/#twitter) if you already have access. You can request access to the Twitter DM API [here](https://gnipinc.formstack.com/forms/account_activity_api_configuration_request_form)
