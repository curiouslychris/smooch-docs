# Whispers FAQ

## How can I create a automatic message that welcome my users?
Click the arrow next to the button “Create a whisper” on the whisper tab of the Smooch dashboard.

## How can I send a whisper triggered by a custom event?
You can send whispers triggered by a custom event added to your website. Here’s an example [gist](https://gist.github.com/Go-Fred/35235e42134347f21e2d2fa2215df2f0) that illustrates how to do this.

## How can I proactively start a conversation with my user?
You can easily engage with your customers with our whispers feature. Whispers allows you to automatically send a message to a targeted group of users at exactly the right time. You can for example send a whisper to welcome your users or promote an event.  

## On what platform can my users receive whispers?
Our whispers are supported on iOS, Android, Web, SMS, Telegram, Line and e-mail.

## How do I send a whisper when a user visits a specific page?
When choosing your audience on our whisper page, you can select ‘Current URL’ is … This will trigger the whisper when the user loads this specific URL.  

## How to send whispers to a user with a custom property like ‘VIP’?
Smooch lets you set custom properties to your users through our web messenger or the API. You can then use those properties as a targeting option when you create your whisper.

## I can't seem to use 'As soon as user fits audience' rule when also using the 'platform' rule. Is this possible?
Whispers for a specific audience can only be triggered by an event.

## How to create a recurring whisper?
A whisper will only be sent once. You can always use our [API](http://docs.smooch.io/rest/#post-message) to send messages to your customers programmatically.
